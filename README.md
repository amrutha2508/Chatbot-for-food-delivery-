# Chatbot-for-food-delivery
-> Leveraged Google's Dialogue Flow ES for robust natural language understanding and processing. This involved designing intents, entities, and contexts to enable effective conversation flows.
-> To manage incoming requests from the chatbot interface, a FastAPI backend was implemented. Its asynchronous capabilities were used to handle concurrent user interactions in an effective manner.
-> Used MySQL as the database management system to store order information and used SQL queries with FastAPI to easily execute database activities.
-> Integrated webhooks for real-time communication between the chatbot and FastAPI backend. This facilitated the handling of various events, allowing the bot to respond dynamically to user inputs
