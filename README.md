# Chatbot-for-food-delivery
1. Leveraged Google's Dialogue Flow ES for robust natural language understanding and processing. This involved designing intents, entities, and contexts to enable effective conversation flows.
2. To manage incoming requests from the chatbot interface, a FastAPI backend was implemented. Its asynchronous capabilities were used to handle concurrent user interactions in an effective manner.
3. Used MySQL as the database management system to store order information and used SQL queries with FastAPI to easily execute database activities.
4. Integrated webhooks for real-time communication between the chatbot and FastAPI backend. This facilitated the handling of various events, allowing the bot to respond dynamically to user inputs
